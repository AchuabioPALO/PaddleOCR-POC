Dear Sirs,
34-36 CAINE ROAD
We refer to your letter of 8th January 1990 informing us
of your impending works at the above location.
Enclosed are part plans showing the approximate position
of our Company's cables in the vicinity of your proposed works.
Please note that the plans showed the record of our cables at the
time the plans were prepared. You may expect to find our cables
located in different positions and depths depending on such
factors as when the cables were laid,obstructions in the area,
the location of other utilities, changes due to continuous
alteration, improvement and extension of our network and changes
due to continuous road and property developments etc.
Since our cables are energised and our enclosed plans
show only their approximate, rather than exact, positions, it is
imperative that your contractors and employees exercise extreme
care during any excavations that may be required and take every
precaution to prevent accidents to personnel and to our cables.
Remember cables when damaged may explode and cause death or injury
to your employees or the general public. In addition, damage to
our cables may lead to a suspension of our supply of electricity
to many domestic, commercial and industrial users. Under all
circumstances, the precise positions and depths of our cables
should be located by hand excavation prior to the commencement of
work. Heavy machinery such as drills or excavators should never
be used for such purposes. Contractors should also note that in
many cases our cables are protected by siabs, which should be
correctly replaced if removed during works.
If our cables are in any way damaged in the course of,
or as a result of your work, we shall hold you fully responsible
and liable for all costs incurred and for any claims from third
parties arising from that damage.
