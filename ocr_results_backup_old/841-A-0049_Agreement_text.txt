Dear Sir,
Aberdeen Swimming Pool
Site meeting attended by Messrs. J.R. Matthews, N.M. Bux, and
N.L. Chang of your company and K.H. Cheng of this office on 12.4.77
refers.
This is to confirm that repair work to the roof of the transformer
room has been completed and that you have no ob jection to the construction
of a stainless steel drainage trough in the ceiling of the transformer
room. The trough is to serve as a protective measure against the possible
danger of water seepage from the roof through the expansion joint.
In this context I would also like to refer to the telecon. between
Messrs.. J.R. Matthews and K. Kan of this office on 14.4.77. I have no
objection to the laying of a H.V cable by your company from the transformer
room to the new access road south of the captioned site for the purpose
of street lighting. However, all remedial work including reinstatement of
the tarmac surface to the service yard in front of the transformer room
has to be carried out by you and at your own expenses immediately thereafter.
For purpose of future reference please let me have three copies of the new
cable route at your early convenience.
Yours faithfullg,
THE HONGKONG ELECTRIC GROUP
